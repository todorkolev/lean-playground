    context: "When reflecting on backtest results"
    details: |
      Before running a backtest, there's usually an expectation:
      - "This should have Sharpe > 1"
      - "Drawdown should be under 20%"
      - "Should work well in trending markets"

      When reflecting:
      1. What was expected?
      2. What actually happened?
      3. Why the difference?

      The gap between expectation and reality is where learnings live.

    context: "When multiple strategies or iterations have been tried"
    details: |
      A single data point is an observation.
      Multiple data points showing the same pattern is a learning.

      Questions to ask:
      - Did the same issue appear in multiple strategies?
      - Did the same fix work multiple times?
      - Is there a common thread in what succeeded vs failed?

    summary: "Capture both what worked AND what didn't"
    context: "When reflecting on any session"
    details: |
      Tendency is to only capture successes. But failures are equally valuable:
      - What approach was tried that didn't work?
      - Why did it fail?
      - What would you tell your past self to avoid?

      Anti-patterns prevent repeating mistakes.
