    context: "When recording any learning"
    details: |
      A learning that says "use X instead of Y" is less valuable than one that explains
      WHY X is better. Include:
      - What problem was encountered
      - Why the old approach failed
      - Why the new approach works better
      - When this might NOT apply

    summary: "Include concrete evidence with specific numbers"
    context: "When capturing learnings from backtests or experiments"
    details: |
      Vague evidence like "performance improved" is less useful than:
      - "Sharpe ratio improved from 0.3 to 0.8"
      - "Drawdown reduced from 25% to 12%"
      - "Win rate increased from 45% to 62%"

      Always include the specific metric and before/after values.

    summary: "Avoid overly specific learnings that won't generalize"
    context: "When abstracting from a specific situation"
    details: |
      Bad: "In the BTC momentum strategy on Jan 15, RSI 14 worked better than RSI 7"
      Good: "Longer RSI periods (14+) reduce noise in high-volatility assets"

      Extract the general principle, but note the specific context where it was discovered.
